## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
plot_1972 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year==1972) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=gdpPercap,y=lifeExp,colour=continent,size=year,text=country)) +
  geom_point()+
  scale_x_log10()+
  scale_size(range=c(1,3))+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")

  ggplotly(plot_1972,tooltip = "all")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
